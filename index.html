        <p>Sales Dogs: You don’t have to be an attack dog to explode your income.</p>
<p>3/10/18</p>
<p>Different types of sales dogs</p>
<p><strong>Pitbull:</strong> The most aggressive and most stereotyped salesperson. Used car salesmen example.</p>
<p>Tips from the pit bull: When in doubt, do something. Do anything. Just make a sales call. Making even a  bad decision creates movement, action and can be corrected upon.</p>
<p>This habit will open more doors and generate more momentum that you would ever imagine possible.</p>
<p>Golden retriever: To the retriever, customer service is everything. The more you give prospects the more they will love you and the more they will eventually buy.</p>
<p>Much different than the seek and destroy methods of the pit</p>
<p>Always be the first to give. True in a negotiation, sale, argument etc. Gives first has the advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Poodle: </strong>Live in a world of high class sales. Presentation is everything. Flashy. The poodle is the ultimate marketing dog. Sell big ticket items. </p>
<p>Learn to speak well to groups and practice this art as often as you can. One on one skills are important, but being able to speak before a crowd increases exposure and confidence 100x.</p>
<p>Learn how to present yourself physically through grooming and attire.</p>
<p><strong>Chihuahua: the data driven one</strong></p>
<p>Learn how to learn. Get to know your specific learning strategy and learn how to absorb critical material. Experience first, talk about it afterward, write down what you’ve learned.</p>
<p>Basset hound: Integrity, consistency and trustworthiness.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Learn to listen. Track your ear to the listener</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn to match body language and modality of the language of the person you are talking to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Play to your strengths. The purpose of a cold call is not to sell anything, but to train yourself for sales situations.</p>
<p>Adopt winning skills when you need them. Assimilate the behavior and skills that are a bit foreign to them can learn to be the ultimate sales dog.</p>
<p>Conditioning and training process is the repetition of drills and skills that may come naturally to other breeds, but are often foreign to yourself. The conditioning is only for burning the pathway in your brain.</p>
<p><strong>Checklist for motivating high-performance salesdog teams</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Celebrate all wins. Actively acknowledge all participation and tasks well done.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Establish a code of honor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Debrief all wins and learning experiences early and often.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use peer pressure to motivate the pack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t try and teach pigs to sing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use common terms vs convoluted corporate-speak.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feed the hot hand. WHen you’re on a roll, keep fueling the fire until it cycles out.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set short term goals that can be accomplished quickly and cleanly. Most dogs have very little concept of the future. They can scarcely thing beyond dinner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get your dogs to practice standing in the head of pressure, confrontation and challenge often so they will become used to it. Be sure to surface and acknowledge the emotion that arises. The object.rejection system is good.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Manage and address emotional needs more than tangible needs</p>
</li>
<li><p>Give them a way to feel that they are contributing something to a higher purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Establish and maintain ritual behavior, events and routines that promote team, family and camaraderie.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always look for champions and allies within the team and use them to lead the team.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look for and acknowledge heroes all the time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find a way to change the environment, mood routine or physical location when the team gets stuck mentally or emotionally. Don’t get lethargic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Manage and focus on energy and emotions continually.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Throw their problems beck to them to solve.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be a student of people, psychology, management and change.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4 mindsets of champion sales dogs</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Face the challenge</p>
<ol>
<li>Strength can come from the past. You must learn to capture those successes and use them in the present.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Respond to negative experiences</p>
<ol>
<li>Shift the blame away from you. Prospect having a bad day, bad timing, information was unavailable to you, personal issues.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>MEMORIZE THIS</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Problem occurs</p>
</li>
<li><p>As soon as you discover the problem, you experience a flash of emotion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dialogue in brain begins</p>
</li>
<li><p>“<strong>What am I saying to myself right now?”</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>In 10 seconds you can recognize that you are using a universal descriptive work. Always, never, every time, all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you recognize that word, check in smile and say “there it is”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mentally correct the universal word to..”this time”, “just happens that”, “in this case it didn’t work”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ask yourself, how would you really want to be feeling right now.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Respond to a successful endeavor: Celebrate all wins</p>
<ol>
<li>A physical anchoring of the win with a high five handshake etc are all successfully.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>View yourself and other on your team. Project the power of your personal intention.</p>
<ol>
<li>Think of a dog chasing a squirrel. They just GET AT IT.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Training for the hunt: Chapter 11</strong></p>
<p><strong>5 critical skills for salesdog success</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Mastering the art of referrals</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Friend gets prospect to call you</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fend tells the prospect you will call him.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Friend tells you who to call and allows you to mention that he or she referred you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Friend gives you a name, any name.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Never jump on strangers. Never ever ever neglect existing clients. They are the greatest source of add-on sales, testimonials and referrals that you have.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Delivering on powerful presentations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tapping the desire to serve others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Managing the personal marketing versus selling formula.</p>
</li>
<li><p>S/M = Sales Effort</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The more marketing you do, the less selling effort you have to deal with. The more quality time you spend marketing, the less you have to physically sell. Prospects put their hands up and come looking your you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>S * M = Results..double the M spend half the time on sales.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Handling of objections or rejections.</p>
<ol>
<li>When a prospect says no, all he is saying is he is not interested in your product at this time or that he doesn’t understand something. It is not a reflection on you.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Create coop relationships with other individuals or companies that are already in contact with your prospects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Send out sales letters</p>
</li>
<li><p>Advertise</p>
</li>
<li><p>Volunteer at industry functions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Conduct free educational seminars</p>
</li>
<li><p>Generate testimonials and referrals</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Of all the things you can learn, the time you spend on the subject of handling rejections and objections is the most valuable.</strong></p>
<p>At first, it’s important to just hear objections/rejections and just say “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Follow the objection with honest probing questions. Then reiterate and restate the objection.</p>
<p>In corporate sales “honor thy client’s secretary”. Treat them as they were the decision-marker.</p>
<p><strong>Direct sales are three things</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Prospects</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Appointments - telephone or face to face</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Making arrangements(closing)</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t worry about qualifying prospects in the beginning.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Sales is an energy business, what you expend comes back. So just getting out there and speaking to people is valuable from an energy-generation POV.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You could be wrong, but they might know someone that does need a website.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It will assist you to get desensitized to rejection and you can practice your objections on a relatively unimportant prospect.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 1: You should never be talking to anybody who does not know who you are.</strong></p>
<p>Step 2: Make initial contact in whatever way you are most comfortable.</p>
<p>E-mail and then follow-up phone call.</p>
<ol>
<li>THank them for taking the call, assure them it won’t take super long and ask if they received the intro communication and if they have any questions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 3: Do your market research.</strong> Learn everything you can about the prospects business and industry. Being equipped with information will give you confidence and show prospects that you take them seriously.</p>
<p>Prepare a list of questions that you would like to ask the prospect in advance, and rehearse them as if you’ve never done this before.</p>
<p>Know what kind of person you are talking to.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: The appointment</strong>. Be well groomed and well dressed. If you look good, you feel good and that comes across in your communication. </p>
<p>Be excited, enthusiastic and be happy.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>As you walk into the appointment remember on what you want to focus on what you want to happen as an outcome to the meeting. Anchor that positive moment by reliving the moment in your head and allowing yourself to feel that emotion.</p>
<p>Design a conversation solely to find out as much as you can about the prospect. <strong>Ask about what they do, why they do it, why they like it, what their ideals are and what their frustrations and problems are. DO NOT TRY TO SELL. Spend time asking relevant questions. Be truly interested, but not interesting.</strong></p>
<p>How did you hear about our service or product?</p>
<p>What particular needs do you have regarding our service or product?<br>WHen this product or service was referred to you, what was it that specifically sparked your interest?</p>
<p>2nd level of questions</p>
<p>Ask questions about the prospects themselves, their business and the nature of their needs and what they specifically want. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Their specific tangible goals</p>
</li>
<li><p>Their opinion about how to implement or make use of the product or service</p>
</li>
<li><p>Their emotional expectation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Present a proposal from that conversation, outlining how the customer will reach those goals in question.</p>
<p>Step7 7: Give them whatever they want. </p>
<p>“If I could wave a magic wand, what is it that you really want in terms of xyz”</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: CLosing</strong></p>
<p>When would you like delivery? How quickly would you like to begin? How soon would you like to begin to take advantage of this opportunity?</p>
<p><strong>Nutshell</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gaining prospects</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Speak to people you know first</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make initial contact the way you are most comfortable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do your market research</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Appointments</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make great first impression</p>
</li>
<li><p>Focus on what you want to happen at the appointment in advance, not on your fears.Make an appointment to call or visit again..a reason to stay in touch.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Give them whatever they want.</p>
<p><strong>Making arrangements</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Ask questions and handle objections. Listen and watch your prospect for buying signals.</li>
</ol>
<p>Career cycle</p>
<p>Retail sales &gt; Corporate sales &gt; network marketing / franchise sales &gt; Entrepreneur sales &gt; business sales.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If you cannot sell, then you cannot run a successful business. You have to sell to your customers, vision to your staff, investors associates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cannot or will not put together a team. Have to be able to gather others who have more skill than you in specific areas. Enough confidence in your adea.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Seek opportunities. Enablement. Barrier to Override. Ownership. Feedback.</p>
<p>Dogs don’t think about it. They look across the room, see you as an opportunity for some companionship and simply walk over and nuzzle their sloppy face into your lap. Try it - it might work.</p>

        <p>The automatic customer by john warrillow</p>
<p>Read: 2/21/18</p>
<p><strong>Part I</strong></p>
<p>Business are much easier to sell that have some form of recurring revenue.</p>
<p>Find two forms of revenue. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Installation revenue for building the main site/project whatever.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Monitoring revenue in the form of the monthly payment for keeping an eye on things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason amazon is so successfull with prime. Is that people want to ‘get the most of it’ and buy from amazon.</p>
<p>Subscription model is back in full swing because people trust enter their credit card online, internet speeds are fast.</p>
<p>The internet has lowered the cost of distribution  for many products and services.</p>
<p>Customers want to express their individuality and increasingly they are using subscriptions to do that.</p>
<p>Amazon, adobe, microsoft, apple are all moving towards subscription models to supplement their income 5 to 10%.</p>
<p>Subscription models are cannibalizing local pet food stores, vitamin shops etc.</p>
<p>Subscriptions are <strong>good because….</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>They increase the value of your largest asset.</p>
<ol>
<li>Most businesses are valued at discounted cash flow.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>MRR: monthly recurring revenue</p>
<p>ARR: annual…duh</p>
<p>Security businesses that monitor alarm systems and charge a recurring monthly monitoring fee to do so are worth around double what security businesses that just do system installations are worth.</p>
<p>Example: Mosquito squad. Subscription based pest control vs you call when their is a problem.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The $29 sale vs the $4,524 sale. Flower shop example</p>
</li>
<li><p>Smooth out demand</p>
</li>
<li><p>Free market research</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get paid automatically</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In a subscription business, the model is reversed. The customer subscribes and pays.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Customers get sticky..from the convenience of it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Subscribers purchase more</p>
</li>
<li><p>Recession-proof your business. Focus on high margin recurring maintenance revenue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Part II</strong></p>
<p>9 subscription business models.</p>
<p><strong>“How could this model be applied to web development?”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“What part of this model could I borrow for FM Web Studios?”</strong></p>
<p><strong>The membership website model:</strong></p>
<p>Publishing your know-how behind a paywall that requires members to buy and access to your secrets.</p>
<p>This could be applied to web development in creating a course in how to build a site, how to make your site accessible.</p>
<p>If you have developed a unique approach to running your business or have been able to achieve above average results in a competitive industry, other web people may want to know about it.</p>
<p><strong>The most financially successful membership websites tend to focus on helping business owners master a specific industry or niche.</strong></p>
<p>Restruantowner.com</p>
<p>Contractorselling.com</p>
<p>B2B sites are some of the more successful memberships.</p>
<p>Monetizing your members…the subscription could be an entry into selling a larger ticket item.</p>
<p>$7 article example to a $1500 conference.</p>
<p><strong>The best response rate will always come from customers who bought something similar less than three months prior.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who the membership website model works best for</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consider it if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A tightly defined niche market, dance studio owners or italy junkies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Access to steady flow of unique knowledge or expertise/insider information that is constantly changing and that subscribers need to stay in the know about.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Another product or service you can sell to your subscribers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What the insiders say</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The most profitable membership sites are those of B2B companies that solve a real problem. Offering must have information and maintaining constantly evolving forums that require a subscriber stay lower over the long term.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Most successful operators produce a piece of content in multiple formats (video, podcast, blog/transcript) to accommodate subscriber preferences for consuming information and increase the chances the site will be found by Google’s search engine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can be difficult to make a good living from just revenue you get from subscribers along. So having other ways to monetize through adjacent selling (conferences, courses, coaching) is the best way to build a significant business around a membership website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The all you can eat library model</strong></p>
<p>Early iTunes example in early 2000s.</p>
<p>Vs current day spotify.</p>
<p>Netflix, hulu pandora etc.</p>
<p>Winning formula is  a two stepped approach.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Get unique visitors to your website to opt in to a relationship with your company by subscribing to an e-mail newsletter or joining a facebook fan page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then convert opt-ins to paying subscribers through a sales funnel.(what is a sales funnel?)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The private club model</strong></p>
<p> Mastermind groups.</p>
<p><strong>Consider it if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Something that is in limited supply, always a service or experience and is in high demand among affluent consumers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Font of the line model</strong></p>
<p>Buy your way to the front of amusement park rides.</p>
<p>Salesforce: everyone gets basic level support. Submit a ticket and you can get a response within 2 business days. If you want it faster than 2 business days pay more. 15 minutes turnaround pay even more</p>
<p>You’re being transparent about who gets served first, which is in some ways fairer than deprioritizing customers without telling them why.</p>
<p>You can offer faster response times through an application like zendesk/desk can easily route subscribers to the front of the que.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the front of the line model</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A complex product or service</p>
</li>
<li><p>Customers who are not price sensitive</p>
</li>
<li><p>Customers who waiting in line too long can have catastrophic results(lost revenue etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Front of the line model can be used in conjunction with other subscription models to add additional stream of recurring revenue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Need a good reputation for baseline service.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leverage technology/systems to automatically put these customers to the front</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The consumables model</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dollar shave club</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI</a></p>
<p>Must differentiate yourself..mega retailers or e-tailers: Let us buy your or we’ll put you out of business.</p>
<p>Ie. facebook to instagram.<br>Facebook stories vs snap</p>
<p>Best defense is branding.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Must differentiate to care about the product</p>
</li>
<li><p>Focus on building a brand</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When comparing apples to apples, amazon will most definately be cheaper and faster.</p>
<p>The more we beleive a product is unique and offers a better experience, the more the providor has the leeway to set his own price.</p>
<p><strong>The surprise box model</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ie. blue apron</strong></p>

<p><strong>Insiders</strong></p>
<ul>

</li>
<li><p>Part of the value prop is you will remember to do a task so your customer doesn’t have to. Make sure to setup a regular schedule.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Its also a platform for cross selling and upselling. Delivering the tasks associated with your service conract offers a built in way to see what else you could provide your customer</p>
</li>
<li><p>You don’t need to bundle all of your services in a contract, just pick the ones a customer needs regulary and those tasks should act as a platofrm to ensure you’re the first person they think of for other jobs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Network model</strong></p>
<p><strong>The utility of the subscription gets more and more valuable as more people subscribe to it.</strong></p>
<p>Ie. facebook, telephone companies.</p>
<p><strong>Peace of mind mode</strong></p>
<p>Offers insurance against something your customers hope they’ell never need.</p>
<p>Website monitoring services. Site24x7.com or dotcom monitoers.</p>
<p>Radian6.</p>
<p>Reputationloop etc</p>

<p>Underwriting profit: is the difference between premiums generated and claims paid, while float is the money you make investing the cash people pay in insurance premiums before they make a claim.</p>
<p>You could keep the $75/month in your pocket….or you could invest it. Invest it into the stock market or a vanguard blended fund..or put the money back into your business to make you even more money or save some more time.</p>
<p>Big insurance companies employ an army of actuaries who use statistical models to predict the likelehood of a claim being made.</p>
<p>Tread lightly</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Offer the peace of mind subscription to only a few handful of customers so you can get a sense on how the claim is made.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Limit your customer offer. Offer to cover fixes up to a certain dollar amount</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reinsure the risk</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 4</strong></p>
<p>The psychology of selling a subscription.</p>
<p>Subscription fatigue. Once more and more subscriptions the small monthly charges add up.  Our bar for a subscription service is getting higher.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Think 10x vs 10%: Make the customer enjoy the alternative 10x more than the competition.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Appear to their rational side.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Give the customer an ultimatum</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Netflix, salesforce etc are 100% all in on the subscription model.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Give them the freemium option</p>
</li>
<li><p>Offer a trial</p>
<p>Osler example. A bajillian 14 day free trial options.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Zendesk example. Have the main focus not on buying the product, but on using the product. This will become the endowment effect in psychology. If you use the product there is a greater chance of you becoming a subscriber.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Offer your subscription as a gift.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set fire to the platform.</p>
<p>Have an ‘oh shit’ moment where you drop the price briefly or offer a good deal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The best salespeople set fire to the platform only when the customer has made the decision to subscribe and it is only a question of <em>when.</em></p>
<p>CAC = Customer acquisition cost.</p>
<p>LTC = lifetime value of the customer</p>
<p>Chrun  = cancellation rate of customers.</p>
<p>3:1</p>
<p>LTV: CAC</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 15: Scaling Up</strong></p>
<p>Can have a growth business or lifestyle business. Can have a ton of freedom with this and fund mini-sabbaticals.</p>
<p>Lowering Churn.</p>
<p>First step is to understand WHY they are leaving your business.</p>
<p><strong>If your customers can avoid your product or service and they still get their jobs done, you’ll have a MUCH higher churn rate than if they need to interact with your service to complete their daily tasks.</strong></p>
<p>Watch the 90 day onboarding clock.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Afte the first 90 days the customers LTV and profitability will have been practically set in stone.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Customers expect a high level of interaction</p>
</li>
<li><p>They expect to be asked for personal information</p>
</li>
<li><p>They are in switch mode and are open to new offers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>They are much more likely to defect before ‘bedding in’</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a subscription to stick, customers need to change their behavior and <strong>use </strong>your service.</p>
<p>Need to track a group of cusomers called <strong>co-horts</strong></p>
<p>Have co-horts of 3 and try different things on each of them.</p>
<p>Reduce churn #3: wow up front</p>
<p>Churn #4: Charge up front..weed out people not super commited.</p>
<p>Offer a price reduction if they pre-pay for a year. 10%. Charign up front and using your service for a year makes your service ‘stickier’ deeper commitment and end up staying longer as a result.</p>
<p>Churn #5: Over communicate</p>
<p>6-7 points of contact is ideal..</p>
<p>Churn #7: Drop a hapiness bomb.</p>
<p>Drop a small gift of spontinaety.</p>
<p>Amazon patent ‘anticpioatory shipping’</p>
<p>Chrun #7: Target larger businesses</p>
<p>Larger businesses..more stable more employees and less likely to change strategy ona  dime.</p>
<p>Churn #8: Focus on net churn</p>

        <p>Their are a few different ways to create class methods. You can create render methods with a class method. Be a little more declarative and use ES6. Or be ‘the best’ and use a stateless functional component.</p>
<p>Destructing is typically a good idea, to make the react code less cluttered. Use stateless componenets whenever possible, functional way to use components and also offer some performance benefits.</p>

        <p>I am being put on an exciting new project at work that uses, you guessed it, react!</p>
<p>It seems that react is the hot new thing for us. It has many benefits of delivering content client side and is much easier to develop in than our standard C# .NET libraries.</p>
<ul>
<li>All we really need is a text editor and an API endpoint and we are pretty much good to go. </li>
<li>This on a large scale reduces our server load and delegates it to the client. </li>
<li>Rich site interactions</li>
<li>Faster website rendering after inital load</li>
<li>Great for web apps</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, its the hot new thing in the web development world and it seems that’s where things are headed. </p>
<ul>
<li>Another benefit is that it is easier to hire for and seek out candidates that know this stack. Plus, it is always smart to add new skills to your resume.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Performance-gains"><a href="#Performance-gains" class="headerlink" title="Performance gains"></a>Performance gains</h2><ul>
<li>No full page load required</li>
<li>Lazy loading is possible(load only what you need)</li>
<li>Cheaper hosting and easy deployments</li>
</ul>
<p>I am currently <a href="http://frankthedogsitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dog sitting</a> in the mountains in a town called Nederland which is about 40 minutes from my work in Boulder, CO. I have a free bus pass that work provides me and I don’t like driving, so I’d rather take the bus and be productive.</p>
<p>Over the next work week, I will delve into react esseintail training and post on what I have learned here. Hopefully you will learn something new!</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>There is a little quirk on how the android soft-keyboard totally messes with css orientation rules. It’s probably a lesser known gotcha, but it tripped me up longer than I would have liked. Here I will explain it and how to get around it.</p>
<p>I was targeting a very specific set of devices using a media query of <code>(orientation: portait)</code> whenever the user selected the search bar the on screen soft-keyboard would open up on the android tablet and it would then break my styles.</p>
<p>I reached out to my team and another developer noticed that when the height was changed it would also break the layout in the same manner as the keyboard popping up. I did some google fu and came accross two excellent links.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8883163/css-media-query-soft-keyboard-breaks-css-orientation-rules-alternative-solut" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stackoverflow-soft-keyboard-breaks-orientation</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141109111220/http://abouthalf.com/development/orientation-media-query-challenges-in-android-browsers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">android-bowser-orientation-change</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It ultimately has to do with how orientation is calculated as I was using <code>(orientation: portrait)</code>. The W3 calculates orientation portrait by checking if the height or width is greater, not the actual device orentation itself. So you could still have the device upright but if the height is less than the width you are in “landscape” mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#orientation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W3.org says</a><br><strong>The ‘orientation’ media feature is ‘portrait’ when the value of the ‘height’ media feature is greater than or equal to the value of the ‘width’ media feature. Otherwise ‘orientation’ is ‘landscape’.</strong></p>
<p>So when the keyboard pops up the height is less than the width and it breaks out of the <code>(orientation: portrait)</code> media query. iOS doesn’t have this issue because the keyboard is overlaid over the browser window vs resizing the actual browser.</p>
<p>So the solution is to stuff the styles that you want to still be applied in an <code>(orientation: landscape)</code> media query.</p>

        <p>I’ve had this book on my to read list for years, and I had a long weekend dog sitting and was able to finish it in one sitting on the back porch on a beautiful Sunny colorado day. I am definitely on the right path, most of the advice that is relevant to me is toward the beginning part of the book. The building of career capital part. In a few years, the next parts will be more relevant as I try and work remotely full-time.</p>
<p>The narratives of this book follow a common thread. THe importance of ability ie be good at what you do. To follow in the words of Steve Martin, Be so good they can’t ignore you.</p>
<p>Rule #1: Don’t follow your passion</p>
<p>Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion.</p>
<p>Career passions are rare, passion takes time and passion is a side effect of mastery</p>
<p>Self determination theory is the best understanding science currently has on why some pursuits excite us.</p>
<p>3 basic psychological needs required to feel intrinsically motivated for your work.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Autonomy: The feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Competence: The feeling that you are good at what you do.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Relatednedss: The feeling of connection to other people</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Working right, trumps finding the right work.</p>
<p>Passion could be dangerous and has made people leave their jobs with no career capital, yoga example.</p>
<p>Focus on the craftsman mindset. On what value that you’re producing in your job vs the passion mindset on a focus on what value your job offers you. </p>
<p>Jordan Tice, guitar player example. Always tried to focus on the process of practicing. </p>
<p>Think of “How can I be really good?”</p>
<p>Track the hours that you spend each month, learning something new and building something with that knowledge.</p>
<p>Turn the attention to the quality that you produce.</p>
<p><strong>Regardless of how you feel about your job right now, adopting the craftsman mindset will be the foundation on which you’ll build a compelling career.</strong></p>
<p>The power of career capital</p>
<p>If you want a great job, then you need to build up rare and valuable skills to offer in return.</p>
<p>Craftsman mindset…what can I offer the world.</p>
<p>Traits that define great work. Creativity, impact and control. Now how do you get these traits into your own working life?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>THe traits that define great work are rare and valuable</p>
</li>
<li><p>Supply and demand says that if you want these traits you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. Think of these skills are career capital that you can offer. Ie programming, accessibility niche, automated testing, javascript, speaking at seminars</p>
</li>
<li><p>The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on becoming “so good they can’t ignore you” is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital. This is why it trumps passion mindset if your goal is to create work you are proud of.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Three traits that disqualify for applying the craftsman mindset</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The job has few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The job focuses on something you think is useless or bad for the world.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The job forces you to work with people you really really dislike.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Alex Berger and Mike Jackson example on adopting the craftsman mindset.</p>
<p>Always seeking feedback on his scripts, just like you should always be seeking feedback on your code with a peer review.</p>
<p>Basically be serious about doing your job well. Ensure that your attention is focused on the activities that matter.</p>
<p>Becoming a craftsman..deliberate practice. The difference in strategy that separates average guitar players from stars like jordan tice is not confined to music. </p>
<p>You need to stretch your ability and receive immediate feedback. Which is the key to successfully acquiring career capital in almost any field.</p>
<p>Skill stretching deliberate practice.</p>
<p>10k hour rule made popular by malcolm gladwell.</p>
<p>Emphasizing serious study: Pouring over books and using teachers to help identify and then eliminate weaknesses.</p>
<p>Focus on difficult activities, carefully chosen to stretch our abilities where they most need stretching and that provide immediate feedback.</p>
<p>Deliberate practice to describe a style of serious study, activity designed for the sole purpose of improving specific aspects of an individual’s performance.</p>
<p>Materials can be deliberately chosen or adapted such that the problems to be solved are at a level that is appropriately challenging.</p>
<p>Focusing on difficult activities, carefully chosen to stretch your abilities where they most need stretching and that provide immediate feedback.</p>
<p>If you just show up and work, you will soon hit a performance plateau beyond which you fail to get any better. This is what I think is currently happening with my web development/ programming career.</p>
<p>Deliberate practice then is the key to quickly becoming so good they can’t ignore you.</p>
<p>To successfully adopt the craftsman mindset, therefore, we have to approach our jobs in the same way that Jordan approaches his guitar playing or Kasparov approaches his chess playing</p>
<p>Alex Bergers example of “A never ending quest to get better, it’s like a sport, you have to practice and you have to study.”</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Decide what capital market you are in.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>WInner take all and auction</p>
</li>
<li><p>Programming, the only ability is to write good code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Identify your capital type</p>
</li>
<li><p>Define ‘good’</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Get clear goals. Deliberate practice requires clear goals.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>FInish teamtreehouse fullstack JS course.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get a freelance web developer position/contract gig.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Stretch and destroy (The current step I am doing). </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that is exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands. Deliberate practice demands an all effort of focus and concentration. That is what makes it ‘deliberate’ as distinct from the mindless playing of scales or hitting of tennis balls that most people engage in. OR watching beginner programming tutorials over and over again.</p>
<p>Deliberate practice is not enjoyable. It feels like a stretch. It is an uncomfortable sensation in your head that kinda feels like a physical strain, as if neurons are physically reforming into new configurations. That stretching feeling is the precondition to getting better.</p>
<p>THis is what you should experience in your own pursuit of ‘good’. If you’re not uncomfortable, then you’re probably stuck and an ‘acceptable’ level and you should seek out more responsibility.</p>
<p>Now that is only part 1, part 2 is embracing honest and candid feedback. Ie code reviews with senior mentors/teachers.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s from harsh feedback where you learn where to retrain your focus in order to continue to make progress.</p>
<p>Keep a constant stream of feedback coming. Ask advice from people that will tell you what is working and what is not working in your writing.</p>
<p>Continuous and harsh feedback he received accelerated the growth of his ability.</p>
<p>Step 5: Be patient</p>
<p>I thought, if I stay with it for 20 years and anyone who sticks with something for 20 years will be pretty good at it.</p>
<p>There is an importance of diligence. Without this patient willingness to reject shiny new pursuits, you’ll derail your efforts before you acquire the capital that you need.</p>
<p>You stretch yourself, day after day, month after month and then finally look up and realize…Hey I’m pretty good at this and people are starting to notice.</p>
<p>I’m not going to write up the rule #3 and #4 because they are not super relevant to me yet, but they are definitely worth a read if you are at that stage where you’re career capital is at a good level. 2 more years left for me and then I will focus on the additional rules. Until then, thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Goals and contingencies are important, sure, but they exist in the future and in the past.</p>
<p>Practice, the path of mastery exists only in the present state.</p>
<p>To love the plateau is to love the external learning. Enjoy the accomplishments and accept the plateau that waits just beyond them.</p>
<p>Be in the hands of a master teacher.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Teacher mentor.</p>
</li>

<p>Early stages of learning you should have the spirit of the fool. Learning any kind of skill involves certain indignities. First few dives are sure to be belly flops, and everyone is bound to see them.</p>
<p>If you want to get there, be prepared to take it.</p>
<p>Surrendering to your teacher and to the fundamentals of the art are only the beginning.</p>
<p>Surrender means there are no experts, only learners.</p>
<p>Mental game is 50% visualization</p>
<p>40% setup</p>
<p>10% swing</p>
<p>Every master is a master of vision.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>To learn is to change….educate, books, behavior, changes the learner</p>
<p>The path of learning never ends…..</p>
<p>Getting energy for master</p>
<p>Best remedy for alertness if aerobic exercise.</p>

<p>Me: I’m not as good of a programmer that I’d like to be. Not much of a social life outside of the college bunch not as good with the ladies yet as I’d like to be, I sleep in late and go to work late.</p>
<ol>
<li>Try telling the truth</li>
</ol>
<p>4 .Set your priorities.</p>
<pre><code>A, B, C, D etc. of the day/week.
</code></pre><ol>
<li><p>Make commitments and take action.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get on the path to mastery and stay on it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Inconsistency is my biggest pitfall.</p>
<p>Consistency is the practice if the mark of the master.</p>
<p>Continuity of time and place can establish a rhythum that bouys you up and carries you along your path.</p>
<p> Remember, most of life if in-btween time. That is it is waking up, getting, dress, commuting, working until llunch, taking lunch, working to 5,..NONE OF THAT COUNTS..but it should and does!</p>
