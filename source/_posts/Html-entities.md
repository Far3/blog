<h1>Helpful HTML entities.</h1>
Its often quite challenging to find a one stop shop for unicode characters or html entities that you often see in the protoypes. You can go about creating icons in a number of different ways. 

<ul>
  <li>You could replace them with CSS via `content` but that creates accessibility issues.</li>
  <li>You could use a sprite but then you have to map out the coordinates just right, and is quite anoying to resize.</li>
  <li>Or you could use something like font awesome</li>
</ul>

A very helpful site that I came accross recently is the one at the web address below. It is a quick interactive reference of 14,500 HTML
character entities. They have everything that I have needed when putting togather quick prototypes in the browser. You don't have to mess with sprites, SVGs or font awesome. I'd highly reccommend you check it out.
