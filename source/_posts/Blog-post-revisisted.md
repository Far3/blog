I really wanted to start a blog around this time last year. I really did and I regret not doing so. I was still in school, working at a call center during the day and riding my bike in the Colorado winters 4 miles down and back for night school. I’d later learn that everything I learned at the community college was outdated, but I did do a few very important things. 

1. It got me an interview at my current company.
2. Introduced to the very basics of programming. 

My blogging plan was to follow my experience going from someone just about finishing school and to their very first paid internship. Hooray no more answering phone calls for a living! Well school got fairly busy and I honestly slacked off in writing the blog. I origionally got the idea from John Sonmez over at <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com" target="_blank">simpleprogrammer.com</a>. Their is even a 3 week course that <a href="http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/" target="_blank">walks you through the entire process.</a>

I remember applying for the internship and thought, this is way over my head but I’ll apply anyways. I then received an email from HR with a few basic screening questions. What does semantic HTML mean to you, in your own words? I passed that and got invited to a phone interview. It went well and it went longer than normal, which is usually a good sign. I put my <a href="http://codepen.io/franklynroth" target="_blank">Codepen Account</a> on my resume and the hiring manager actually poked around and asked me about my school projects. He asked how can this be made better. It was the midterm project for my JavaScript class.

I stumbled through something about how I am setting the value twice and I could just grab it from the HTML? I honestly had little to no idea. He then says “Yea, I’d like to see that”. Let’s setup a time to meet in the office next week. After the call I was ecstatic but also horrified that I had to figure out how to make this calculator better. After all weekend, lots of google, stackoverflow and coffee I had a solution. <strong>From 64 lines of JavaScript down to 18</strong>.

I didn’t have a car at the time, so I rode my bike and took 3 buses to get from Fort Collins, CO to the office in Boulder, CO for the interview. It was in February and thankfully in the mid 50s. Interview went really well, and the next day as I was writing the thank you letter I got an email from HR that they are moving to a  formal offer for the Summer 2015 internship. Internship went well and I eventually landed up on the Front End Development team after it.

I again restarted this blog after wishing I had posts of what I was doing during the first few weeks of the internship, the middle and the stressful last few weeks with everyone wondering  if they were getting offers or not. 

John Sonmez was a big motivator in his free blogging course and is like the Tim Ferriss of software development/lifestyle design. His course pushes homework on you and to my pleasant surprise, he responds to every email I have sent. I definitely enjoyed the course and his advice on <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com" target="_blank">simpleprogrammer.com</a> is more and more helpful as I settle into my new developer role. The actual course link is <a href="http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/" target="_blank">here</a>

The blog will be about all the things I experience in my first year as a front-end web developer. <strong>Expect to see course content on all things HTML, CSS and JS and how to extend your soft skills to have successful code reviews, standups and taking initiative on presentations.</strong>
