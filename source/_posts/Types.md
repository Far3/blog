<p>In OOP every object is of a certain type. Whenever you use `int`, `double`, `string` etc these are types. You can create your own objects for a particular type as well. This is done with using a class.
</p>

<p>An easy way to think of a class is a cookie cutter. The cookie cutter is the class or template on how to make cookies. It is not a cookie itself, just a template. Classes are templates for amking objects of a particular type. Each time a cookie is create it is called an instance of that Cookie class. You can make many copies of cookies over and ocer and can make them a little different by changing their attributes.
<p>

<p>
Typically you would declare a class with an uppercase letter.
```

namespace Bake
{
  class Cookie
  {
    public Void Main()
    {
      Cookie cookie = = new Cookie();
    }
  }
}

```

<p>The above code create a new variable called cookie and assigns it to a new Cookie object. Typically you want to keep the variables a meaningful name. This is how to instnatiate an object from the Cookie class.
</p>
<p>So to recap</p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Frank" is an object of type string.</li>
  <li>The `new` keyword is used to create a new object or instance of that class</li>
  <li>In a GUI, each individual button is a distinct object.</li>
  <li>Classes are templates from which objects are created from</li>
</ul>
